### Getting Started

#### Controllers

Controllers are typically stored in the `app/Controller` directory, however they can technically live in any directory or any sub-directory. All controllers should extend the `App\Base\Controller` class. The Base Controller is also stored in the `app/Base` directory, and may be used as a place to put shared controller logic.

`php bin/console generate:resource controller ControllerName`

#### Models

Models are typically stored in the `app/Model` directory. 

`php bin/console generate:resource model ModelName`

#### Presenters

Presenters are typically stored in the `app/Presenter` directory. 

`php bin/console generate:resource presenter PresenterName`

#### Middleware

Middleware are typically stored in the `app/Middleware` directory. 

`php bin/console generate:resource middleware MiddlewareName`
